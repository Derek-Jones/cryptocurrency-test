Test cases for crypto licensing hackathon software

Usual README information...

A friction free method for developers to obtain licensing
income from their projects on Github.

A developer places a file, named .cryptolicense,
in the top level directory of any project they
want a licensing revenuw stream.

Potential licensee clicks on link in README.md or
enters the Github project's url into out website.

Information in the repo's .cryptolicense file is read to
obtain amount of Bitcoin to be paid and the license terms.

Confirm payment set up via the licensee's Bitcoin wallet.

Information identifying the licensing terms and the two
parties involved are saved in the transaction block that
is written to the blockchain.

All licensing transactions are public and can be displayed
by entering licensee details...
